# Current Context

## Development Status

**Project State**: Production-Ready Template Complete  
**Last Updated**: 2025-09-06

## Current Focus

The project briefs have been updated to implement **mono-repo architecture** with domain-specific Clean Architecture and enhanced database and API tooling:

- **Mono-repo structure** where each domain has its own complete Clean Architecture
- **Domain isolation** with self-contained domain packages
- **UUIDv7 implementation** for index-friendly database performance
- **Shared infrastructure** for cross-domain concerns, including standardized API responses (jSend)
- **Flexible Database Migrations**: Integration of `node-pg-migrate` or `umzug` with `pg` driver for robust schema management
- **Bun ORM Integration**: Leveraging Bun's ORM and query builder for type-safe SQL queries and data access
- **Repository Abstractions**: Implementation of repository classes/functions to encapsulate data access and enable mocking
- **Enhanced Testing**: Support for mocking repository methods with `jest`/`sinon` and database layer tests with `pg-mock`/Bun query mocking

## Recent Major Updates

### Architecture Evolution
- **Updated briefs to mono-repo architecture**: Each domain now has its own complete Clean Architecture implementation
- **UUIDv7 integration**: Replaced standard UUID with UUIDv7 for better database indexing performance
- **Domain isolation**: Each domain (`src/domains/{domain}/`) is self-contained with its own layers
- **Shared infrastructure**: Cross-domain concerns moved to `src/shared/`, including standardized API responses (jSend)
- **Database Migration Flexibility**: Introduced support for `node-pg-migrate` or `umzug` with `pg` driver for database migrations, alongside Prisma Migrate
- **Bun ORM for Data Access**: Adopted Bun's ORM and query builder for type-safe SQL interactions
- **Repository Pattern Refinement**: Emphasized repository interfaces and abstractions for improved testability and data access encapsulation
- **Enhanced Testing Capabilities**: Integrated `jest`/`sinon` for mocking repository methods and `pg-mock`/Bun query mocking for database layer testing
- **Hono.js brief updated**: follows mono-repo domain-specific Clean Architecture patterns

### Previous Implementation (Current Running State)
- Implemented complete Clean Architecture structure (traditional layered approach)
- Added full JWT authentication system with User domain
- Created two example domains (Greeting, Posts) with full CRUD operations
- Setup comprehensive testing with Bun test runner
- Configured production-ready development tooling (ESLint, Prettier)
- Implemented Docker containerization with multi-stage builds
- Created comprehensive documentation and README

### Migration Path
The current implementation follows traditional Clean Architecture, while the updated briefs propose mono-repo domain-specific architecture for future implementations.

### ðŸ”„ Working API Endpoints

**Authentication:**
- `POST /auth/register` - User registration
- `POST /auth/login` - User login  
- `GET /auth/profile` - Protected profile endpoint

**Greeting Domain:**
- `GET /greeting` - Get greeting message
- `POST /greeting` - Create new greeting

**Posts Domain:**
- `GET /posts` - Get all posts
- `GET /posts/:id` - Get post by ID
- `GET /posts/author/:authorId` - Get posts by author
- `POST /posts` - Create post (protected)
- `PUT /posts/:id` - Update post (protected)
- `DELETE /posts/:id` - Delete post (protected)

## Development Environment

- **Runtime**: Bun (latest) - Fully operational
- **Package Manager**: Bun - All dependencies installed
- **Database**: SQLite with Prisma - Migrations applied
- **Server Port**: 3000 - Currently running in background
- **Hot Reload**: Enabled and working
- **Tests**: 7 tests passing (unit + integration)
- **Linting**: ESLint configured and passing
- **Formatting**: Prettier configured and applied

## Architecture Status

The project now fully implements the target architecture from brief.md:
- **Domain Layer**: User, Greeting, Post models with base entities
- **Repository Layer**: Full implementations with Prisma integration
- **Use Case Layer**: Business logic for all domains
- **Handler Layer**: HTTP handlers with proper error handling
- **Infrastructure Layer**: DI container, auth middleware, database connection
- **Testing Layer**: Comprehensive test coverage

## Ready for Use

The template is now ready to serve as a robust foundation for:
- New backend projects requiring Clean Architecture
- Teams needing consistent project structure
- Rapid API development with authentication
- Scalable applications with proper separation of concerns
- Production deployment with Docker containerization
