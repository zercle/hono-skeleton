# Current Context

## Development Status

**Project State**: Production-Ready Template Complete  
**Last Updated**: 2025-09-06

## Current Focus

The project is now a **complete production-ready backend template** featuring:

- Full Clean Architecture implementation with layered structure
- Complete JWT authentication system with middleware protection
- Two example domains (Greeting & Posts) demonstrating the full pattern
- Comprehensive development tooling and testing setup
- Docker containerization ready for deployment
- Extensive documentation and developer experience features

## Recent Major Implementation

### Session Completion
- Implemented complete Clean Architecture structure
- Added full JWT authentication system with User domain
- Created two example domains (Greeting, Posts) with full CRUD operations
- Setup comprehensive testing with Bun test runner
- Configured production-ready development tooling (ESLint, Prettier)
- Implemented Docker containerization with multi-stage builds
- Created comprehensive documentation and README

## Current Implementation State

### ðŸ”„ Working API Endpoints

**Authentication:**
- `POST /auth/register` - User registration
- `POST /auth/login` - User login  
- `GET /auth/profile` - Protected profile endpoint

**Greeting Domain:**
- `GET /greeting` - Get greeting message
- `POST /greeting` - Create new greeting

**Posts Domain:**
- `GET /posts` - Get all posts
- `GET /posts/:id` - Get post by ID
- `GET /posts/author/:authorId` - Get posts by author
- `POST /posts` - Create post (protected)
- `PUT /posts/:id` - Update post (protected)
- `DELETE /posts/:id` - Delete post (protected)

## Development Environment

- **Runtime**: Bun (latest) - Fully operational
- **Package Manager**: Bun - All dependencies installed
- **Database**: SQLite with Prisma - Migrations applied
- **Server Port**: 3000 - Currently running in background
- **Hot Reload**: Enabled and working
- **Tests**: 7 tests passing (unit + integration)
- **Linting**: ESLint configured and passing
- **Formatting**: Prettier configured and applied

## Architecture Status

The project now fully implements the target architecture from brief.md:
- **Domain Layer**: User, Greeting, Post models with base entities
- **Repository Layer**: Full implementations with Prisma integration
- **Use Case Layer**: Business logic for all domains
- **Handler Layer**: HTTP handlers with proper error handling
- **Infrastructure Layer**: DI container, auth middleware, database connection
- **Testing Layer**: Comprehensive test coverage

## Ready for Use

The template is now ready to serve as a robust foundation for:
- New backend projects requiring Clean Architecture
- Teams needing consistent project structure
- Rapid API development with authentication
- Scalable applications with proper separation of concerns
- Production deployment with Docker containerization
