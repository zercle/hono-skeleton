# Product Definition

## Project Purpose

This is a **Hono.js backend mono-repo template** on the **Bun** runtime that adopts domain-specific Clean Architecture within each domain package. It provides a standardized, scalable foundation for backend API development with clear domain isolation, SOLID principles, and modern tooling out of the box.

## Problem Statement

Backend project setup often involves repetitive configuration of routing, database integration, dependency injection, authentication, and project structure. Developers waste significant time setting up these foundational elements for each new project, leading to:

- Inconsistent project structures across teams
- Time spent on boilerplate code instead of business logic
- Lack of standardized patterns for scalable architecture
- Manual configuration of common backend requirements

## Solution

This boilerplate provides:

- **Domain-specific Clean Architecture**: Each domain package contains a full layered architecture (entities, use cases, repositories, handlers, routes, models, tests) for clear domain isolation and SOLID compliance
- **Modern Tech Stack**: Hono.js (fast web framework) on Bun runtime (fast JavaScript runtime)
- **Scalable Mono-Repo Structure**: Domain-driven design with self-contained domain modules
- **Ready-to-use Integrations**: Prisma ORM for database, tsyringe for dependency injection, JSON Web Tokens for authentication, Bun ORM for type-safe SQL queries
- **Flexible Database Migrations**: Support for `node-pg-migrate` or `umzug` with `pg` driver for robust database schema evolution
- **Repository Abstractions**: Encapsulated data access logic through repository classes/functions, enabling mock testing
- **Standardized API Responses**: JSON API responses formatted according to the `omniti-labs/jsend` specification via middleware/helpers
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Enhanced testing capabilities with `jest`/`sinon` for mocking repository methods and `pg-mock`/Bun query mocking for database layer tests
- **Development Tooling**: TypeScript, Bun test runner, ESLint, Prettier configured out of the box

## Expected User Experience

### For Developers

- **Quick Setup**: Clone, configure environment, and start developing business logic immediately
- **Clear Patterns**: Follow established patterns for adding new domains/features, including database migrations and API response handling
- **Scalable Growth**: Architecture that grows with project complexity
- **Developer Productivity**: Hot reload, TypeScript support, and comprehensive tooling

### For Teams

- **Consistency**: All projects follow the same architectural patterns
- **Knowledge Transfer**: New team members can quickly understand any project using this template
- **Best Practices**: Built-in patterns for testing, error handling, and code organization

## Success Criteria

The boilerplate is successful when developers can:

1. Start a new backend project in under 5 minutes
2. Add new API endpoints following clear, established patterns
3. Scale the application without architectural refactoring
4. Onboard new team members quickly due to familiar structure
5. Focus on business logic rather than infrastructure setup
