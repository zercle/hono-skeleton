# Product Overview

## Project Purpose
This is a **Hono.js Backend Mono-Repo Template** designed to provide a production-ready foundation for building scalable backend APIs using modern TypeScript practices. The template implements Domain-Driven Design with Clean Architecture patterns to ensure maintainable, testable, and well-structured code.

## Problem Statement
Many backend projects start without proper architectural foundations, leading to:
- Tightly coupled code that's difficult to maintain and test
- Inconsistent project structure across different domains
- Lack of standardized patterns for dependency injection and data validation
- Poor separation of concerns between business logic and infrastructure
- Difficulty scaling teams due to unclear code organization

## Solution Approach
This template addresses these issues by providing:
- **Clean Architecture**: Clear separation between entities, use cases, repositories, and handlers
- **Domain-Driven Design**: Each business domain is self-contained with its own complete architecture
- **Modern Stack**: Leveraging Hono.js for performance and Bun for speed
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation with Zod validation
- **Dependency Injection**: Using TSyringe for proper inversion of control
- **Standardized Patterns**: Consistent structure and conventions across all domains

## Target Users
- Backend developers building REST APIs
- Teams looking for scalable architecture patterns
- Projects requiring strict separation of concerns
- Organizations standardizing on TypeScript/Node.js backends
- Developers transitioning from other frameworks to Hono.js

## Expected Behavior
The template should enable developers to:
1. **Quick Start**: Set up a new backend project in minutes
2. **Domain Addition**: Easily add new business domains following established patterns
3. **Scalable Development**: Support multiple developers working on different domains simultaneously
4. **Production Readiness**: Include all necessary tooling for deployment and monitoring
5. **Testing**: Comprehensive test setup for unit and integration testing
6. **Documentation**: Auto-generated API docs with OpenAPI/Swagger

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Testability without real data access:
  - All business logic and HTTP handlers must be testable using in-memory or fake adapters via dependency injection
  - Provide in-memory repository implementations for every repository interface
  - Testing configuration must enable swapping infrastructure adapters via DI without touching production code
  - External integrations must be accessed via ports to allow mocks/fakes in tests
- Graceful shutdown:
  - Handle SIGINT and SIGTERM
  - Stop accepting new connections, drain in-flight requests with a configurable timeout
  - Close database connections and other resources cleanly
  - Flip readiness to unhealthy during drain, keep liveness healthy until exit
  - Force close and emit structured error logs if timeout elapses

## Key Features
- **Bun Runtime**: Fast JavaScript runtime with built-in package manager
- **Hono.js Framework**: Lightweight, fast web framework
- **Clean Architecture**: Proper layering and dependency inversion
- **PostgreSQL + Drizzle**: Type-safe database operations
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure token-based auth
- **Docker Support**: Containerized deployment
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions setup
- **API Documentation**: OpenAPI/Swagger integration
- **Environment Management**: Proper config and secrets handling

## Success Metrics
A successful implementation should provide:
- Sub-100ms response times for simple CRUD operations
- Clear domain boundaries with minimal cross-domain dependencies
- High test coverage (>90%) across all layers
- Consistent code patterns across all domains
- Easy onboarding for new developers (< 1 day to productivity)
