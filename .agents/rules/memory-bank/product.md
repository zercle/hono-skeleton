# Product Definition

## Project Purpose

This is a **Hono.js Backend Boilerplate Template** designed to provide a standardized, scalable foundation for backend API development using the Bun runtime. The project serves as a starting template for developers who want to quickly bootstrap backend applications with modern tooling and clean architecture principles.

## Problem Statement

Backend project setup often involves repetitive configuration of routing, database integration, dependency injection, authentication, and project structure. Developers waste significant time setting up these foundational elements for each new project, leading to:

- Inconsistent project structures across teams
- Time spent on boilerplate code instead of business logic
- Lack of standardized patterns for scalable architecture
- Manual configuration of common backend requirements

## Solution

This boilerplate provides:

- **Standardized Clean Architecture** with clear separation of concerns across layers
- **Modern Tech Stack** using Hono.js (fast web framework) on Bun runtime (fast JavaScript runtime)
- **Scalable Project Structure** following domain-driven design principles
- **Ready-to-use Integrations** for database (Prisma), DI (tsyringe), authentication (JWT)
- **Development Tooling** with TypeScript, testing, linting, and formatting preconfigured

## Expected User Experience

### For Developers

- **Quick Setup**: Clone, configure environment, and start developing business logic immediately
- **Clear Patterns**: Follow established patterns for adding new domains/features
- **Scalable Growth**: Architecture that grows with project complexity
- **Developer Productivity**: Hot reload, TypeScript support, and comprehensive tooling

### For Teams

- **Consistency**: All projects follow the same architectural patterns
- **Knowledge Transfer**: New team members can quickly understand any project using this template
- **Best Practices**: Built-in patterns for testing, error handling, and code organization

## Success Criteria

The boilerplate is successful when developers can:

1. Start a new backend project in under 5 minutes
2. Add new API endpoints following clear, established patterns
3. Scale the application without architectural refactoring
4. Onboard new team members quickly due to familiar structure
5. Focus on business logic rather than infrastructure setup
